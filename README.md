### Installation

As this is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, we expect you have [JHipster and its related tools already installed](http://jhipster.github.io/installation.html).

This module requires Jhipster version greater than 3.0 in order to work

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-snowflake
```

Then run the module on a JHipster generated application:

```bash
yo jhipster-snowflake
```

If you want don't want to answer each question you can use

```bash
yo jhipster-snowflake default
```
This will enable snowflakeing for all available entities (only ones created by the jhipster:entity generator) and add the snowflake log page under admin
